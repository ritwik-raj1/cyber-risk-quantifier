# 🚀 CyberRiskSim  

**CyberRiskSim** is a **FastAPI-powered cyber risk quantification tool** that leverages **Monte Carlo simulations** and **FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk) principles** to estimate the financial impact of cyber threats.  

---

## 🔍 Key Features  

✅ **Risk Calculation API** – Uses security maturity, vulnerability data, and threat intelligence to estimate risk.  
✅ **Monte Carlo Simulation** – Generates probabilistic risk estimates based on thousands of simulations.  
✅ **Threat Intelligence Integration** – Fetches real-time threat levels (e.g., CISA KEV) to refine calculations.  
✅ **Interactive Dashboard** – Built with **Streamlit** for intuitive visualization of risk insights.  
✅ **Modular & Extensible** – Designed for easy integration into security workflows.
